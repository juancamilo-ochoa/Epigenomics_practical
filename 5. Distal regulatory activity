### Study distal regulatory activity

### Task 1: Create a folder regulatory_elements inside epigenomics_uvic. 
This will be the folder where you store all your subsequent results.

mkdir regulatory_elements
mkdir data analyses annotation

### Task 2: Distal regulatory regions are usually found to be flanked by both H3K27ac and H3K4me1. 
### From your starting catalogue of open regions in each tissue, select those that overlap peaks of H3K27ac AND H3K4me1 in the corresponding tissue. 
### You will get a list of candidate distal regulatory elements for each tissue. How many are they?

### Create folders for the bigBed and bigWig files
### To obtain the bigBed peaks of both H3K27ac and H3K4me1, I copied the metadata file from the hands on to the regulatory elements folder

mkdir data/bigBed.files data/bigWig.files

### Download bigBed H3K27ac peak calling files

grep -F H3K27ac metadata.tsv |\
grep -F "bigBed_narrowPeak" |\
grep -F "pseudoreplicated_peaks" |\
grep -F "GRCh38" |\
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{print $1, $11, $23}' |\
sort -k2,2 -k1,1r |\
sort -k2,2 -u > analyses/bigBed.H3K27ac.peaks.ids.txt

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.H3K27ac.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  wget -P data/bigBed.files "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/$filename/@@download/$filename.bigBed"
done

### Download bigBed H3K4me1 peak calling files

grep -F H3K4me1 metadata.tsv |\
grep -F "bigBed_narrowPeak" |\
grep -F "pseudoreplicated_peaks" |\
grep -F "GRCh38" |\
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{print $1, $11, $23}' |\
sort -k2,2 -k1,1r |\
sort -k2,2 -u > analyses/bigBed.H3K4me1.peaks.ids.txt

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.H3K4me1.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  wget -P data/bigBed.files "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/$filename/@@download/$filename.bigBed"
done

# Convert bigBed files of both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks to BED files with the bigBedToBed command:

mkdir data/bed.files

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.H3K27ac.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  bigBedToBed data/bigBed.files/"$filename".bigBed data/bed.files/"$filename".bed
done

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.H3K4me1.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  bigBedToBed data/bigBed.files/"$filename".bigBed data/bed.files/"$filename".bed
done

# Intersection of the both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks in sigmoidal colon

bedtools intersect -u -a data/bed.files/ENCFF724ZOF.bed -b data/bed.files/ENCFF872UHN.bed > analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.sigmoid_colon.txt

# Intersection of the both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks in stomach

bedtools intersect -u -a data/bed.files/ENCFF844XRN.bed -b data/bed.files/ENCFF977LBD.bed > analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.stomach.txt

### Obtain the number of peaks in the intersection

wc -l analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.sigmoid_colon.txt
wc -l analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.stomach.txt

### A total of 53615 peaks were found in sigmoid colon and 40992 in stomach.

### Task 3: Focus on regulatory elements that are located on chromosome 1 , and generate a file regulatory.elements.starts.tsv that contains the name of the regulatory region (i.e. the name of the original ATAC-seq peak) and the start (5') coordinate of the region.

grep -w "chr1" analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.sigmoid_colon.txt | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{if ($6=="+"){start=$2} else {start=$3}; print $4, start}' > analyses/regulatory.elements.starts.sigmoid_colon.tsv

grep -w "chr1" analyses/peaks.analysis/peaks.H3K27ac.H3K4me1.stomach.txt | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{if ($6=="+"){start=$2} else {start=$3}; print $4, start}' > analyses/regulatory.elements.starts.stomach.tsv

### Task 4: Focus on protein-coding genes located on chromosome 1. 
### From the BED file of gene body coordinates that you generated here, 
### prepare a tab-separated file called gene.starts.tsv which will store the name of the gene in the first column, 
### and the start coordinate of the gene on the second column (REMEMBER: for genes located on the minus strand, the start coordinate will be at the 3'). Use the command below as a starting point:

### For this I copied the file with the gene body coordinates in the annotation folder inside regulatory_elements folder

grep -w "chr1" annotation/gencode.v24.protein.coding.gene.body.bed | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{if ($6=="+"){start=$2} else {start=$3}; print $4, start}' > analyses/gene.starts.tsv

Task 5: Download or copy this python script inside the epigenomics_uvic/bin folder. 
Have a look at the help page of this script to understand how it works:

python bin/get.distance.py -h

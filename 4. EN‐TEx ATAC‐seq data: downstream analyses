#### 4. EN‐TEx ATAC‐seq data: downstream analyses

#### Move to folder ATAC-seq, and create folders to store bigBed data files and peaks analyses files. 
#### Make sure the files are organized in a consistent way as done for ChIP-seq.

### Run the docker container

sudo docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --rm -it dgarrimar/epigenomics_course

### Move to the ATAC-seq folder and create the folders for downstream analyses

cd epigenomics_uvic/ATAC-seq/
mkdir data
mkdir analyses
mkdir annotation


### Retrieve from a newly generated metadata file ATAC-seq peaks (bigBed narrow, pseudoreplicated peaks, assembly GRCh38) for stomach and sigmoid_colon for the same donor used in the previous sections. 
Hint: have a look at what we did here. Make sure your md5sum values coincide with the ones provided by ENCODE.


### Download the metadata for the ATAC-seq experiment for stomach and sigmoid colon cancer

../bin/download.metadata.sh "https://www.encodeproject.org/metadata/?replicates.library.biosample.donor.uuid=d370683e-81e7-473f-8475-7716d027849b&status=released&status=submitted&status=in+progress&assay_title=ATAC-seq&biosample_ontology.term_name=stomach&biosample_ontology.term_name=sigmoid+colon&type=Experiment"

### Create folders for bigBed and bigWig files

mkdir data/bigBed.files data/bigWig.files

### Download bigBed peak calling files

grep -F ATAC-seq metadata.tsv |\
grep -F "bigBed_narrowPeak" |\
grep -F "pseudoreplicated_peaks" |\
grep -F "GRCh38" |\
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{print $1, $11, $23}' |\
sort -k2,2 -k1,1r |\
sort -k2,2 -u > analyses/bigBed.peaks.ids.txt

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  wget -P data/bigBed.files "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/$filename/@@download/$filename.bigBed"
done

# Convert bigBed files of ATAC-seq peaks to BED files with the bigBedToBed command:

mkdir data/bed.files

cut -f1 analyses/bigBed.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename; do
  bigBedToBed data/bigBed.files/"$filename".bigBed data/bed.files/"$filename".bed
done

### Create the peaks analysis folder

mkdir analyses/peaks.analysis

### The file with list of promoters ([-2 kb, +2 Kb] from TSS) of protein-coding genes provided in class was stored into the annotation folder.

### Running the intersection analyses to find the peaks in the promoter regions ([-2 kb, +2 Kb] from TSS)

cut -f-2 analyses/bigBed.peaks.ids.txt |\
while read filename tissue; do 
 bedtools intersect -a annotation/gencode.v24.protein.coding.non.redundant.TSS.bed -b data/bed.files/"$filename".bed -u |\
 cut -f7 |\
 sort -u > analyses/peaks.analysis/genes.with.peaks."$tissue".ATAC-seq.txt
done

### Obtain the number of peaks that intersect promoter regions

wc -l analyses/peaks.analysis/genes.with.peaks.sigmoid_colon.ATAC-seq.txt
wc -l analyses/peaks.analysis/genes.with.peaks.stomach.ATAC-seq.txt

### The number of peaks in sigmoidal colon was 14830 and in stomach was 15029

### 2) the number of peaks that fall outside gene coordinates (whole gene body, not just the promoter regions).
